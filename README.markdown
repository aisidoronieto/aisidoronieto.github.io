Bootstrap cards are very fluid and easily adapt to the size of the screen. For example, on a big computer screen, the cards arrange themselves in a gallery format, just like in Pinterest. When you see the same contents on mobile devices, they arrange themselves in a vertical format for a thumb-friendly design. This flexible nature of the bootstrap cards makes them not only a secondary element but also a core element in a design. We managed to collect some design concepts as well in this bootstrap cards examples list so that you can adopt a unique design in your project.
